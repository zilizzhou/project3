1. The challenges we faced while making the app:
a. We were stuck on the async issue for many hours. 
b. Not undertand will about promise, so get confused about the .exec(), .then() and so on. Further study needed.

2. Given more time, firstly, we would solve async issue more efficient. (but this would base on very good understand of some concept lol, I know async is very important for js)
Second, a deeper look into session/cookie is meanfuling!
More features: I would add all the extra credits features; more complex user authenticate would be implemented; better UI

3. What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?

4. Hours spend:
